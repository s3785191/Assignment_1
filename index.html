		<p>
			Hello! My name is Steven Lim. I am of Cambodian/Chinese culture where my parents grew up. Other than English, I speak Teochew (chinese dialect language).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I recently completed VCE at Salesian College Chadstone (2018), leaving with a strong interest in technology and programming.
	  </p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Fun fact!</strong> I enjoy gaming for most of my free time. I also have a passion for computers and building a PC ever since I discovered it in 2016. I learned how to build one from watching YouTube videos. Ever since I built my first gaming computer in early 2018 my friends have been asking me to help them with their own builds and asking me for advice on what specific components they should put in their system as if I'm a complete expert. I've built/helped build 7 gaming computers including my first PC.

		<h2 align="center" style="color: hotpink">My Interest in I.T</h2>
		
		<p>
			My interest in I.T is primarily programming. It became an interest midway through high school when I was studying an I.T subject which involved programming. I was doing well in that subject but I also enjoyed it during that time. Thus, I continued to pursue subjects revolving around programming and I.T.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My experiences in I.T were mainly focused on the knowledge of the I.T world and my ability to show my skills in a variety of areas. In the past 3 years I have done 3D modelling, 3D animation, programming in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and HTML code for a website. Programming languages I have learned include ActionScript, Python, Visual Basic and Unreal Engine's blueprints.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I chose to come to RMIT because I knew that I could rely on the education and experience I could get based on the information I received from the open day and recommendations from fellow friends. Further, I decided to choose RMIT because it is easy to get to since it is only one train ride.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I expect to broaden my understanding of I.T and the way it is integrated into our society. I'd like to expand my skills in programming whilst learning new programming languages and techniques, so that wherever I decide to go I will to adapt and showcase my skills.

			<img src="IdealJob.PNG" width="100%" height="100%" alt=""/>
		<p>
			My ideal job will unlikely be at the advertised company and location, however, the responsibilities of the role makes it ideal. The qualities of this job that make it appealling is the ability to contribute to a fully functional game that has many users. However, I like the elements of working with a team, experimenting with old and new ideas, programming a game and being able to see the differences between a prototype from behind the scenes to the final product.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The qualifications required for this position include experience in developing, producing and then shipping games in a professional manner. Further, the skills in a particular programming language, maths and communication are essential for this job. Moreover, the knowledge of how gaming consoles work to ensure an optimised gaming experience in a live service game is needed to fill this role. The position also requires a strong interest and knowledge in games, especially what can make a a game enjoyable and unenjoyable.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Currently I believe that I fulfill three of these qualifications which include strong maths skills, strong communication and interpersonal skills and an interest in games. I have been in a development team previously similar to this position which involved creating a game in a small group. I was required to communicate with, present to and listen to the entire group at various stages in order to successfully develop the game. I enjoy playing games during my free time which is why my interest in games is evident.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In order to be eligible for this position I will strive to learn as many programming languages as I need to be eligible for any position. This way I will, at the very least, understand the code behind the program that I would be working on. However, if I want to be experienced in producing high quality and professional games I will need to start by working on smaller games wherever possible in order to gain that experience I need. Whilst working on these smaller scaled games, I can also gain 'console experience' and have the possibility of working a live service game.

			These results suggest that whilst I may not always be contributing I am accepting of new ideas and I treat everyone with respect. I give every person a chance to contribute with their opinions and being analytical about whether something is reasonable or unreasonable. In terms of learning style, I prefer to interpret and learning visually so that more information can be taken in and processed. I like to be as organised as possible, so that I don't let myself and the team down. I put my efforts in doing my part of a group task, expecting others to do likewise, and helping others if they need it. I prefer to have times of seriousness to be productive but I also don't mind the occasional banter.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When working in a team, these results may influence how I go about being organised myself and enuring that my entire team is also organised so that a task can be completed in a timely fashion. Otherwise, the results shown above will not heavily influence how I working with a team. I will always contribute if and when they need my opinion or ideas. I generally stay focused on a task at hand, however, I never reject an occasional 'break' when it is appropriate.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When forming a team, I should look for people who are dedicated to the task and people I know I can rely on. Those in my group would be people who are confident that they can get their part/role done in collaboration with other team members. From my perspective, a good team is a team that handle working collectively at a constant pace while also maintaining a high level of effort in the task. When I am asked for an opinion, I generally criticise the aspects that need improvement so team members who can improve on their work is important. Improving from my own work is also important, thus, team members who give reasoning for their constructive criticism will make my work better.

		<h3>
			Overview
		</h3>
		<p>
			The electronic reminder product is a system which can be used by anyone. Whether they are an individual or involved in a group or team-based environment this product will assist with the organisation and awareness of issues to be resolved and tasks to be completed. Also, issues that need a solution can be reported and everyone will be notified so that it can be resolved quickly - whether it be a workplace issue or with a task that is currently being worked on. This product will be a software solution.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>
			Motivation
		</h3>
		<p>
			This will be useful mostly for teams/groups that have a task to complete within a timeframe or companies that rely heavily on teamwork. The group can use this product to manage their tasks and assist each other so that tasks/projects can be completed on time. Businesses can use the product for the same reasons, however, they can also use the ‘report an issue’ functionality which will create and spread awareness across to everyone about issues that need to resolved. For businesses, completing a certain task on time could mean more sales/profits rather than a loss in profits and, potentially, consumers.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>
			Description
		</h3>
		<p>
			Tasks - This product allows individuals or teams to create a ‘to-do-list’. The task’s description and its progress status would be sent to everyone in the team/group on a daily/weekly basis. This is so everyone knows what they need to do, what others need to do and when a task needs to be completed.
			The ‘tasks’ will contain the following attributes:
			<ul>
				<li>Name of task</li>
				<li>Category/Department</li>
				<li>People responsible for the task</li>
				<li>Task details (what needs to be done)</li>
				<li>Progress status</li>
				<li>Recommended completion date</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Reporting Issues – The product also allows people to report issues within a workplace, such as a hazard, so that everyone will know about it or report that they are having difficulty with a task. Everyone will be notified when an issue is reported and when an issue is resolved.
			The ‘issues’ will contain the following attributes:
			<ul>
				<li>Name of issue</li>
				<li>Date reported</li>
				<li>Person who reported the issue</li>
				<li>Details of the issue</li>
				<li>Status (unresolved/resolved)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Users will have the option to select either create a task or report an issue. Once the user has selected either option they must fill in the form with all the necessary details before submitting it. After the submission, the form will be formatted into a suitable format and emails will be sent out to notify those involved.
		</p>
		<p>
			Users will need to update the status of tasks they are involved in so that everyone else understands the progress of the task. However, a concern for this system is that users may forget or simply not update the status of the task.
		</p>
		<p>
			Daily reminders will be sent out to everyone showing a list of all the tasks and issues in progress and any new tasks and issues that have been added throughout the day.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>
			Tools and Technology
		</h3>
		<p>
			An appropriate computer is needed so that the software can be created. The computer needs to be able to handle light to moderate processing. Software editors such as Visual Studio, which is free, or Eclipse, which is open source, are needed to program the software. Any of these editors are suitable for creating this software solution. Once the software has been created, the program needs to be stored on computers so that it can be used.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>
			Skills Required
		</h3>
		<p>
			The skills needed for this project include the ability to program/write code using a programming language. No other software or special hardware is needed for this project.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finding the skills, software and hardware required is very feasible. A programming editor is needed for the project which can be obtained for free and in some instances open source. Finding the appropriate tools needed to program the entire software package can be searched online through websites, forums or through a programming tutorial.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>
			Outcome
		</h3>
		<p>
			If the project becomes a successful software solution individuals, businesses and teams can use this software to become more organised in the way they work.
		</p>
		<p>
			The original problems lies within an individual or group who struggle to keep track of or forget about tasks that need to be completed by a certain date. This software is a solution that may not necessarily eradicate the lack of awareness or lack or memory but it will definitely improve the organisation and awareness of what needs to be done and what issues have risen.
		</p>
		<p>
			This development will improve the efficiency at which people work and it may have the likelihood of increasing profitability or decreasing the loss in profit that businesses will appreciate in the future.
